    This paper will cover all the relevant aspects this website to A3, with most of the work being from A1 and A2.
with this website containing five pages. First is the Index page this page is the main page of the whole website and as such
all other pages are directly or indirectly connected to it. This page was given two new buttons called GreyMode and PinkMode,
when these buttons are clicked their relevant Javascript sections will run and change the pages colours to either ones of grey or 
shades of pink. This page meets the code requirements by contantaining two buttons that when clicked will change the colouring of the CSS
to its indicated shade.

Info Page.

    The Info page of this website has been given a fillable form using HTML and Javascript. This form contains five fillable
sections these sections are a one word description of this site, a rating from one to five of this website, along with a place
to provide an email, a hidden phrase section plus a section to verify it, then a ready to submit checkbox, and a final message box. 
These fill out boxes can then be submitted when clicking the button called Submit.This button will light up in a line colour and a 
message stating that the form has been submitted will pop-up at the bottom of the form. The form will not submit if one of the sections 
are not correctly filled out or a section has not been filled, in this event the button will turn red and the message at the bottom of the 
form will read an "Invalid:" message depending on what has been incorrectly filled out. If no section has been filled out then upon hitting 
the submit button an alert will apper at the top of the screen indicating that there was no input. This sections meets several of the 
assignment requirements these are the Notification, the EventHandler, along with the Conditional and the Form sections. 
The Notification requirement is met by the alert message displaying when no input has been given. The EventHandler requirement has been 
met by the Javascript for this section which contains an EventListener for click, which will wait to see if the button is clicked by 
the user and will then execute the section of code it covers. The Conditional has been met by the Form requiring certain aspects to be 
filled out properly and in order to see if they have been met the java script for the form contains an if, eight if else and one else statements. 
Finally the Form section has been met by the Form on the Info pages containg the five required questions along with a check box as stated above.
There is one text input, a number input along with an email two password inputs which are the hidden and veryify phrase sections with the 
form having a final submit checkbox to make sure the user is ready to submit. All inputs have conditionals to verify that they are correct and 
good to submit.
